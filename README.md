# IBM HR Analytics — Employee Attrition


Predicting why employees leave, using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.


## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The goal is to identify key drivers behind employee turnover and build a predictive model to flag at-risk employees. </br>
Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

## Dataset
PropertyValueSourceIBM HR Analytics (Kaggle)FileWA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csvRows1,470 employeesFeatures35 columnsMissing ValuesNoneClass ImbalanceYes — 83.9% No, 16.1% Yes

## Dropped / Useless Features
Three columns are constants and carry zero predictive value — drop them immediately:</br>
ColumnReasonEmployeeCountAlways 1Over18Always YStandardHoursAlways 80

## Key Insights
Overall Attrition Rate

16.12% of employees left — roughly 1 in 6. </br>
Dataset is imbalanced; handle with SMOTE, class weights, or stratified splits.


## Overtime is the Biggest Red Flag
OverTimeAttrition RateNo10.4%Yes30.5% </br>
Employees doing overtime are 3x more likely to leave. This is the single strongest binary signal in the dataset.

## Job Role Matters Enormously
Job RoleAttrition RateSales Representative39.8%Laboratory Technician23.9%Human Resources23.1%Sales Executive17.5%Research Scientist16.1%Manufacturing Director6.9%Healthcare Representative6.9%Manager4.9%Research Director2.5%
Sales Representatives leave at nearly 40% — almost 1 in 2. Senior/director roles are stable.

## Department Breakdown
DepartmentAttrition RateSales20.6%Human Resources19.0%Research & Development13.8%

## Income Gap is Stark
AttritionMean Monthly IncomeNo$6,833Yes$4,787 </br>
Employees who left earned ~$2,000/month less on average. Lower pay = higher flight risk. </br>

## Marital Status
StatusAttrition RateSingle25.5%Married12.5%Divorced10.1% </br>
Single employees leave at more than double the rate of divorced ones. </br>

## Business Travel
Travel FrequencyAttrition RateNon-Travel8.0%Travel_Rarely15.0%Travel_Frequently24.9% </br>
Frequent travellers burn out — nearly 1 in 4 leaves. </br>

## Age
AttritionMean AgeNo37.6Yes33.6 </br>
Younger employees (avg. 33–34) are more likely to leave — likely early-career job hopping. </br>

## Tenure
AttritionMean Years at CompanyNo7.4 yearsYes5.1 years </br>
Employees who leave tend to have shorter tenure — the first few years are the danger zone. </br>

## Job Satisfaction
Score (1=Low, 4=High)Attrition Rate122.8%216.4%316.5%411.3% </br>
Clear trend — lower satisfaction = higher attrition. Score 1 employees leave at double the rate of score 4. </br>

## Work-Life Balance
Score (1=Bad, 4=Best)Attrition Rate131.2%216.9%314.2%417.6% </br>
Score 1 (worst balance) has the highest attrition — 31.2%. Interestingly, score 4 is slightly higher than 3, possibly due to overconfident job hoppers.</br>

## Stock Options
LevelAttrition Rate0 (None)24.4%19.4%27.6%317.6% </br>
No stock options = much higher attrition. Even level 1 cuts it dramatically. </br>

## Distance from Home
AttritionMean DistanceNo8.9 kmYes10.6 km </br>
Small but consistent — employees farther from the office are slightly more likely to leave. </br>

## Gender
GenderAttrition RateMale17.0%Female14.8%
Minor difference — gender alone is not a strong predictor.

## Top Predictors (Summary)
Based on EDA, these are the most important features to include in any model:

OverTime — strongest binary signal</br>
MonthlyIncome — significant income gap </br>
JobRole — Sales Rep vs Director gap is huge </br>
StockOptionLevel — no options = high risk </br>
Age — younger employees leave more </br>
MaritalStatus — single employees leave more </br>
JobSatisfaction — clear inverse relationship </br>
WorkLifeBalance — score 1 is a red flag </br>
BusinessTravel — frequent travel = burnout </br>
YearsAtCompany — early tenure is risky </br>
DistanceFromHome — mild but consistent signal </br>
